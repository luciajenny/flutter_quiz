# Quizzler ‚ùì
## My Goal

Here I applied Stateful and Stateless Widgets as well as learning about the fundamental building blocks of
Object Oriented Programming (OOP) - Classes and Objects.

Here is a Quiz app that tests your general knowledge. Questions and Answers can be customly supplied and updated in the dedicated and private  Question Class in the project.
I was able to modularise the codes int separate classes and used the getter to implement various functionality on subsequent dart files and screens.
Dart List, variables, constants and finals were used to define and use functions and objects within each screen.
